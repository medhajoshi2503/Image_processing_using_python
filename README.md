# Image_processing_using_python
Developing Image Processing Techniques in Python, including SIFT, Canny Edge detection ,Panorama Stitching, and Hybrid Image Creation.
The objective of this project is to develop advanced image processing techniques in Python, including Scale-Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT), Canny Edge detection, Panorama Stitching, and Hybrid Image Creation. These techniques are widely used in various applications such as computer vision, robotics, and medical imaging.

The project will start with an overview of the fundamental concepts of image processing and feature detection. Then, we will implement the SIFT algorithm to detect and describe local features in an image, which is useful in object recognition, image registration, and stitching.

Next, we will implement the Canny Edge detection algorithm, which is a popular method for detecting edges in an image. This algorithm uses gradient information to identify the edges in an image and is widely used in applications such as object detection and tracking.

In the panorama stitching section, we will implement an algorithm to stitch multiple images together to create a panoramic view. The algorithm will involve identifying corresponding features in each image and warping the images to align them properly.

Finally, we will implement the Hybrid Image Creation algorithm, which is a method for creating two images with different spatial frequencies that can be perceived differently when viewed from different distances. This technique is useful in vision research and can be used to create optical illusions.

Throughout the project, we will use Python's scientific computing libraries such as NumPy, OpenCV, and Matplotlib to implement these image processing techniques. We will also visualize the results using graphs and images to demonstrate the effectiveness of these techniques.

Overall, this project will demonstrate the potential of image processing techniques in various fields and showcase the power of Python for scientific computing and data visualization.
